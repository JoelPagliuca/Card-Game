# TIL - stuff I learned doing this project

* WebSocket is neat
* that `.PHONY` line in my Makefile stops make telling me my unit tests have already been built
* lots of Python plugins read from that `setup.cfg` file
* having two separate folders with Python code sucks
* defining a variable that points to the `venv/python` is real good
* had issues running `shallow` with create-react-app
